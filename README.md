Hi, I’m Andrew

I’m a full-stack developer with a strong focus on REST API design and backend architecture.
I work primarily with C#, TypeScript, Python, and recently, Rust.

 - This GitHub is mostly home to my smaller or less flashy projects — if you're curious about the cool stuff I've built, just ask!

TheCircularK/TheCircularK is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
